# plg_search_pagebuilder
Joomla 3.2 plugin that allows search of sp_pagebuilder component pages

This code is kinda bad-structured, and the concept of searching a database with LIKE %searchword% is really crappy, but this plugin is only a fast rework of the original com_content search plugin to enable the search on pages created with the sp_pagebuilder component. This kind of search should not be used on very large sites due to performance reasons.
